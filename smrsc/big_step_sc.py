# Now we formulate an idealized model of big-step multi-result
# supercompilation.
#
# The knowledge about the input language a supercompiler deals with
# is represented by a "world of supercompilation", which is a trait
# that specifies the following.
#
# * `C` is the type of "configurations". Note that configurations are
#   not required to be just expressions with free variables! In general,
#   they may represent sets of states in any form/language and as well may
#   contain any _additional_ information.
#
# * `isFoldableTo` is a "foldability relation". isFoldableTo(c, c') means
#   that c is foldable to c'.
#   (In such cases c' is usually said to be " more general than c".)
#
# * `develop` is a function that gives a number of possible decompositions of
#   a configuration. Let `c` be a configuration and `cs` a list of
#   configurations such that `cs âˆˆ develop(c)`. Then `c` can be "reduced to"
#   (or "decomposed into") configurations in `cs`.
#
#   Suppose that driving is determinstic and, given a configuration `c`,
#   produces a list of configurations `drive(c)`. Suppose that rebuilding
#   (generalization, application of lemmas) is non-deterministic and
#   `rebuild(c)` is the list of configurations that can be produced by
#   rebuilding. Then (in this special case) `develop` is implemented
#   as follows:
#
#       develop(c) = [drive(c)] + map(lambda cs: [cs] , rebuild(c))
#
# * `History` is a list of configuration that have been produced
#   in order to reach the current configuration.
#
# * `isDangerous` is a "whistle" that is used to ensure termination of
#   supercompilation. `isDangerous(h)` means that the history has become
#   "too large".
#
# * `isFoldableToHistory(c, h)` means that `c` is foldable to a configuration
#   in the history `h`.
